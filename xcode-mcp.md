## Summary

Apple's Xcode MCP (Model Context Protocol) provides powerful tools for AI coding assistants integrated into Xcode.

### Notable Tools

**DocumentationSearch**
- Amazing capability for searching Apple documentation directly from AI assistants

**RenderPreview**
- Renders SwiftUI previews directly in the conversation
- Allows AI to visualize SwiftUI components without running the app

**RefreshCodeIssuesInFile**
- Checks *current* compiler diagnostics
- Verifies syntax without a rebuild
- Fast feedback loop for AI-generated code

### Benefits
- AI assistants can verify Swift code correctness in real-time
- Direct access to Apple documentation during coding
- Visual feedback for SwiftUI components
- No need to switch between tools for verification

### Integration
Available through Xcode's MCP integration, allowing AI coding assistants (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.) to access Xcode's internal tools and documentation.
