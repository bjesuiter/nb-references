## My Reference

### Summary

TypeSpec is a language designed for API-first development. It allows you to describe APIs and generate code for multiple languages (TypeScript, Python, C#, Java, etc.) from a single specification.

**Key features:**
- Define APIs and data models in a declarative syntax
- Generate SDKs, client libraries, and OpenAPI specs
- Works with Azure,纳斯珀, and other platforms
- Strong typing and validation

### Content

Useful for:
- b3b/cherry code generation features
- API-first development workflows
- Generating consistent client/server code from specs
- Multi-language SDK generation

**Related to:** OpenAPI, JSON Schema, GraphQL SDL
