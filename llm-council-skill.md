## Summary

**LLM Council** is a Claude Skill that orchestrates multiple LLMs as a "council" instead of querying a single LLM. It derives conclusions through a 3-stage process: Opinion Collection → Peer Review → Final Synthesis.

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's llm-council concept.

## The 3-Stage Process

### Stage 1: Opinion Collection
Each council member (LLM) independently responds to the query:
- Normal mode: Text-based responses
- Worktree mode: Each member generates code changes in independent git worktrees

### Stage 2: Peer Review
All members anonymously review other members' responses:
- Responses anonymized as "Response A", "Response B", etc.
- Each member evaluates and ranks all responses
- Aggregate scores calculate overall rankings

### Stage 3: Final Synthesis
The chairman model integrates all opinions and reviews:
- Considers strengths of each member's opinion
- Reflects issues identified in peer review
- Analyzes consensus patterns and differences
- Provides clear final response representing collective intelligence

## Key Features

- **Git Worktree Integration** — Each member works in independent git worktrees
- **Anonymous Review** — Fair evaluation without bias
- **OpenCode CLI Integration** — Generate and edit code directly
- **Flexible Configuration** — Configure member models and chairman model
- **Real-time Dashboard** — TUI dashboard showing progress and live logs
- **Conversation History** — Save all council sessions in JSON

## Dashboard

Monitor council sessions in real-time:
- **Stage Flow** — Visual progress ([1] Responses → [2] Rankings → [3] Synthesis)
- **Member Status** — 🟢 Active, ⏳ Waiting, ✅ Completed, ❌ Error
- **Live Logs** — Latest 15 log entries scrolling
- **Statistics** — API calls, errors, session info

Enable with `--dashboard` or `-d` flag.

## Setup

### Environment Variables

```bash
cd scripts
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `scripts/.env`:

```bash
# Council Members (comma-separated)
COUNCIL_MODELS=opencode/openai/gpt-4,opencode/anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet,opencode/google/gemini-pro

# Chairman Model (performs final synthesis)
CHAIRMAN_MODEL=opencode/anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet

# Optional: Title generation model
# TITLE_MODEL=opencode/anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku
```

### Requirements

- **Git repository** — Must run within a git repo (uses worktrees)
- **OpenCode CLI** — Must be installed and configured
- **Python 3.8+**

## Usage

### Basic Question
```bash
python scripts/run.py council_skill.py "What's the optimal caching strategy?"
```

### Code Fix (Diff Only)
```bash
python scripts/run.py council_skill.py --dry-run "Fix the bug in buggy.py"
```

### Code Fix (Auto-Merge with Confirmation)
```bash
python scripts/run.py council_skill.py --auto-merge --confirm "Add error handling"
```

### Continue Conversation
```bash
python scripts/run.py council_skill.py --continue 1 "Tell me more"
```

### View History
```bash
python scripts/run.py council_skill.py --list
```

## Merge Options (with --worktrees)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--auto-merge` | Auto-merge top-ranked proposal |
| `--merge N` | Merge member N's proposal |
| `--dry-run` | Show diff without merging |
| `--confirm` | Confirm before merge |
| `--no-commit` | Apply without staging |

## For Project Planning

This is perfect for your **Dynamic Interface Experiment** and **Agent Interfaces with HATEOAS** ideas:

### Example: Plan a New Feature
```bash
python scripts/run.py council_skill.py "Plan a HATEOAS API for a task management app with decision primitives, range inputs, and chart visualizations"
```

The council will:
1. Each LLM proposes an architecture
2. Members review and rank each proposal
3. Chairman synthesizes best approach

### Example: Plan Rust File Sync App
```bash
python scripts/run.py council_skill.py "Plan a Rust-based macOS file sync app with SwiftUI frontend, APFS cloning, and daemon mode for unattended operation"
```

## Configuration Examples

### Small Council (Fast)
```bash
COUNCIL_MODELS=opencode/openai/gpt-4,opencode/anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet
CHAIRMAN_MODEL=opencode/anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet
```

### Large Council (Thorough)
```bash
COUNCIL_MODELS=opencode/openai/gpt-4-turbo,opencode/anthropic/claude-3-opus,opencode/google/gemini-pro,openai/o1
CHAIRMAN_MODEL=opencode/anthropic/claude-3-opus
```

## For Your Skills

This could become a **skill in your agent-skills repo**:

## Comparison: Single Agent vs Council

| Aspect | Single Agent | Council |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Perspectives | One model | Multiple models |
| Review | None | Peer review + ranking |
| Output | Single opinion | Synthesized consensus |
| Robustness | Depends on model | Collective intelligence |
| Speed | Fast | Slower (3 stages) |

## When to Use

**Use Council for:**
- Architecture decisions
- Complex feature planning
- Critical code reviews
- Any decision requiring diverse perspectives

**Use Single Agent for:**
- Simple tasks
- Quick iterations
- Routine coding
