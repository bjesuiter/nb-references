## My Reference

### Key Takeaways

- **Use Codex CLI as daily driver** - Runs 3-8 parallel agents in a 3x3 terminal grid
- **Don't overcomplicate** - Skip subagents, RAG, elaborate agent files - just talk to it
- **Blast radius concept** - Think about impact before throwing tasks at agents
- **GPT-5-Codex advantages**: 230k context vs Claude's 156k, more efficient token usage, message queuing, faster and lighter
- **Prompt with images** - 50% of prompts contain screenshots, model finds strings and matches them directly
- **Refactor days** - 20% of time on refactoring, all done by agents
- **Skip spec-driven development** - Start discussions, iterate, and build together with the agent
- **TL;DR**: Don't waste time on charade. Just talk to it, play with it, develop intuition.

### Summary

A no-nonsense guide to agentic engineering by Peter Steinberger. He uses Codex CLI (GPT-5) with 3-8 parallel agents running in a grid. Key insight: skip subagents, RAG, and elaborate Agent files - just communicate directly. GPT-5 has better context (230k vs 156k), uses tokens more efficiently, and reads more files before starting work. Use images in prompts (model finds what you show), do refactor sprints, and build iteratively rather than spec-first.
