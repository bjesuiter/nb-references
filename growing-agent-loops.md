## Summary

Concept for AI agent systems that can dynamically grow or expand their processing loops based on task complexity or context. Unlike fixed loops, these systems can spawn new sub-agents, add processing steps, or increase context windows as needed.

## Key Ideas

- Loops that aren't static but adapt to task requirements
- Automatic expansion of agent capabilities during execution
- Recursive processing that grows as needed

## Related Concepts

- Autonomous agent loops
- Dynamic agent spawning
- Recursive self-improvement in AI systems
