## My Reference

### Summary

Simon Willison's comprehensive guide to building 150+ "HTML tools" — self-contained single-file apps combining HTML/JS/CSS.

**Key patterns:**
- Avoid React/build steps
- Load deps from CDNs
- Use copy/paste for I/O
- Persist state in URL or localStorage
- Leverage CORS-enabled APIs (iNaturalist, PyPI, GitHub, Bluesky)
- Call LLMs directly via CORS
- Use Pyodide for Python in browser

Includes debugging tools, file handling, and WebAssembly possibilities.
