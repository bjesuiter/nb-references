## Summary

A website that quantifies how much time humanity wastes due to Apple's unfixed bugs. It calculates human hours wasted vs. engineering hours to fix, providing a data-driven argument for **why web apps can be a better choice than native iOS apps**.

## Core Argument

If you depend on Apple's native ecosystem, you're at the mercy of their bug-fixing priorities. Web apps:
- Don't require Apple to fix bugs in their platform
- Update independently of Apple's release cycle
- Avoid being blocked by years-old unfixed issues

## The Formula

**Base Impact:**
```
Users Affected × Frequency × Time Per Incident
```

**Power User Tax:**
```
Σ (Workaround Time × Participation Rate)
```
Extra time spent by people trying to fix what Apple won't fix.

**Shame Multiplier:**
```
Years Unfixed × Pressure Factor
```
How long Apple has known about the bug.

**The Verdict:**
```
Human Hours Wasted ÷ Engineering Hours to Fix
```
How many times over Apple could have fixed the bug with the productivity they've destroyed.

## Use Cases

- Convince stakeholders to choose web apps over native iOS
- Quantify the hidden cost of platform dependency
- Humorously illustrate platform lock-in risks
