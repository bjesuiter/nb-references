## Summary

Astro, the popular web framework for content-driven websites, has joined Cloudflare. Key points:

- **Open-source preserved**: Astro remains MIT-licensed and platform-agnostic
- **All Astro team now Cloudflare employees**: Full-time focus on the framework
- **Astro 6 coming**: Beta is out, release imminent
- **Cloudflare's approach**: Known for supporting open-source without capture (TanStack, Hono)

## Why It Matters

Astro's founder Fred Schott explained the rationale:
- Previously tried to build a business on top of Astro (Astro DB, storefront) but "the distraction took its toll"
- Cloudflare provides resources to focus 100% on the framework
- Shared vision: infrastructure (Cloudflare) + framework (Astro) = better web for content

## Impact

Astro is downloaded ~1M times/week, used by companies like Microsoft, Google, Webflow, Wix.
