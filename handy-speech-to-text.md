### Summary
Handy is a free, open source speech-to-text application for macOS. Simply press a keyboard shortcut, speak, release, and Handy pastes the transcribed text into whatever text field you're currently typing in.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Free** — Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall
- **Open Source** — Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to the project

- **Toggle Mode** — Press once to start, press again to stop transcription
- **Customizable Key Binding** — Change the keyboard shortcut to your preference
