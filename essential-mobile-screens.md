## Summary

The 7 essential mobile app screens that are considered baseline requirements for any mobile application:

1. **Onboarding Screen** - First-time user introduction, explaining app value proposition
2. **Home/Dashboard Screen** - Main entry point showing key features and navigation
3. **Login/Auth Screen** - User authentication (sign up, sign in, password reset)
4. **Profile/Settings Screen** - User account management and app preferences
5. **Feed/List Screen** - Content display (timeline, search results, activity)
6. **Detail Screen** - Detailed view of a specific item/content
7. **Search/Explore Screen** - Functionality to find content or features

## Key Principles

- Keep the number of menu options under 7
- Use subcategories if more options are needed
- Design for limited screen real estate
- Optimize for touch interactions
