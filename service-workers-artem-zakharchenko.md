## Overview

**"And Now You Understand Service Workers"** by Artem Zakharchenko — a deep dive video resource for understanding Service Workers comprehensively.

## Why This Resource

Service Workers are fundamental to:
- **Offline web applications**
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**
- **Background sync**
- **Push notifications**
- **Cache-first architectures**

## What the Video Covers

- Service Worker lifecycle (install, activate, fetch)
- Cache API and caching strategies
- Background sync patterns
- Push notification handling
- Common pitfalls and debugging
- Best practices for production

## Key Concepts

### Lifecycle
1. **Install** — triggered when SW file is fetched
2. **Activate** — cleanup old caches
3. **Fetch** — intercept network requests

### Caching Strategies
- Cache First
- Network First
- Stale While Revalidate
- Network Only

### Common Use Cases
- Offline functionality
- Performance optimization
- Background sync
- Push notifications
- API caching
