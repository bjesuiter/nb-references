## Summary

Joel Hooks was 48, couldn't walk and talk without getting breathless, decided to get fit before 50. Used MyBodyTutor and CrossFit to transform his body and health.

## Key Insights

### The Commitment Problem
- Fought being overweight since middle school
- Pattern: find program → commit → see results → life happens → unravel
- Key realization: "I'd rather not start than start and quit. Quitting is a habit too."

### Making It Non-Negotiable
- Fitness as preparation for aging (paradigm shift)
- "Occasional slips don't break the commitment. You keep going. Imperfection doesn't mean failure — stopping does."
- Travel used to derail everything → needed a plan for staying consistent

### MyBodyTutor Experience
- Weekly calls with coach Walter
- No restrictive meal plans — personalized approach
- Started with baby steps (walks, yoga, tracking food)
- "It's MY program, not Walter's"

### The Power of "What would happen if I did this for a year?"
- Removes pressure of immediate results
- Question changed everything: walks → PT → 5x5 → CrossFit → Conjugate Strength
- After 450 days of tracking → quit counting, focused on strength

### Community Matters
- "CrossFit Fort Vancouver is one of my favorite places on earth"
- Group fitness transformed mental health too
- "I'm the least likely person to enjoy exercising in front of others"

## Result
- Lost 50 pounds
- Strong as fuck, jacked
- "I still eat Sour Patch Kids"
