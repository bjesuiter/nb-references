## Common Monetization Models for Mobile AI Apps

### 1. Subscription (SaaS)
- Monthly/annual access to AI features
- Freemium tier with limited usage
- Pay for more credits or advanced features

### 2. Pay-per-Use
- Credits system for API calls
- Token-based pricing
- Usage-based tiers

### 3. One-Time Purchase
- Paid app with AI features unlocked
- Less common for AI due to ongoing costs

### 4. Advertising
- Free tier with ads
- Native ad integration
- Reward videos for credits

### 5. B2B/Enterprise
- White-label solutions
- API access for other developers
- Custom integrations

## Key Considerations

- **Compute costs**: AI models are expensive to run
- **User expectations**: AI feels "magic" but needs reliability
- **Platform constraints**: Mobile = limited compute, battery, network
- **Differentiation**: What makes your app unique?

## Strategies

1. **Niche down**: Specific use case > general AI
2. **Offline first**: Cache models, reduce API dependency
3. **Hybrid**: Local lightweight model + cloud for heavy lifting
4. **Community**: Build user base before monetization
