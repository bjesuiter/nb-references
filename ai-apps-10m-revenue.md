## Key Strategies for $10M Revenue

### 1. Focus on High-Value Niches

**Target industries with:**
- High spend on existing solutions
- Clear ROI for AI improvements
- Pain points that AI solves well

**Examples:**
- Legal tech (contract analysis, research)
- Healthcare (diagnostics, admin automation)
- Finance (analysis, risk assessment)
- Sales (prospecting, outreach automation)

### 2. Build Product-Led Growth

- **Free tier** → converts to paid
- **Viral loops** → organic growth
- **Low friction** → quick adoption

**Metrics to track:**
- Time to value (TTV)
- Conversion rate (free → paid)
- Net revenue retention (NRR)

### 3. Enterprise Sales

For $10M+, enterprise deals often required:

**Key elements:**
- SOC 2 compliance
- SSO/Enterprise auth
- Dedicated support
- Custom integrations
- SLA guarantees

**Sales cycle:**
- $1-5K: Self-serve
- $5-50K: Sales-assisted
- $50K+: Enterprise (custom)

### 4. Pricing Strategies

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Per-seat** | Predictable revenue | Limits expansion |
| **Per-usage** | Aligns with value | Unpredictable revenue |
| **Tiered** | Upsell opportunities | Cannibalization risk |
| **Enterprise** | High LTV | Long sales cycle |

**Rule of thumb:** Price based on value delivered, not cost + margin.

### 5. Go-to-Market

**For AI apps:**
1. **Product Hunt launch** → initial users
2. **Content marketing** → SEO/authority
3. **Community building** → Discord, Twitter
4. **Partnerships** → integrations
5. **Paid ads** → scale after product-market fit
