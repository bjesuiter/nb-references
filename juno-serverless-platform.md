## Overview

Juno is an open-source serverless platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It enables building, deploying, and running apps in WASM containers with complete ownership and zero DevOps overhead.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | Privacy-first auth for apps |
| **Datastore** | Key-value JSON document store |
| **Storage** | User-generated files/images with access control |
| **Hosting** | Global serving on custom domains |
| **Functions** | Serverless functions in Rust or TypeScript |
| **Analytics** | Privacy-friendly, open-source web analytics (no cookies) |

## Tech Stack

- **Containers:** WASM (WebAssembly) for secure execution
- **Framework Support:** Next.js, React, SvelteKit, Vue, Angular, Astro, Rust, TypeScript
- **Protocol:** Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
- **CLI:** `npm create juno@latest`

## Highlights

- **No cold start** — WASM containers start instantly
- **Zero DevOps** — No infrastructure to manage
- **Self-hosting control** — Complete ownership of data
- **Web3 native** — Runs on ICP blockchain infrastructure

## Quick Start

```bash
# Scaffold a new project
npm create juno@latest

# Or deploy to console
# https://console.juno.build
```
