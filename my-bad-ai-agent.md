# My Bad AI Agent

> "There are many coding agents, but this one is mine."

## The Philosophy

PI represents a counter-movement to heavyweight, all-in-one AI agents. It is designed to be:

### Minimal
- **Only 4 core tools**: read, write, edit, bash
- No bloat, no unnecessary features
- Keeps context clean and lean

### Opinionated
- Clear defaults that work well
- Keyboard-first workflow
- Designed for developers who know what they want

### Extensible
- Skills system for adding capabilities
- Project-level AGENTS.md for context
- Modals for prompt templates

## Why "Bad"?

The name "my bad ai agent" is deliberately provocative:

1. **Anti-marketing** - Rejects the hype of "perfect" AI agents
2. **Personal ownership** - "This one is mine" - you control it
3. **Pragmatic** - Acknowledges imperfection, focuses on utility
4. **Hacker-friendly** - Built for modification, not consumption

## Key Features

### Core Tools
- **read** - Read files
- **write** - Create/overwrite files
- **edit** - Make precise edits
- **bash** - Execute shell commands

### Multi-Provider Support
- Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, Groq, Cerebras, xAI
- OpenRouter, ZAI, MiniMax, Amazon Bedrock, Ollama
- OAuth for Copilot, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Claude, Codex

### Workflow Features
- **Model cycling**: Switch models mid-conversation (Ctrl+P)
- **Sessions**: Tree view, branching, resume any point
- **Compaction**: Auto-summarize long conversations
- **Bash mode**: Prefix with `!` to run commands

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `esc` - interrupt
- `ctrl+c` - clear / twice to exit
- `ctrl+k` - delete line
- `shift+tab` - cycle thinking
- `ctrl+p` - cycle models
- `ctrl+o` - expand tools
- `ctrl+t` - toggle thinking

## Similarities to Clawdbot

PI and Clawdbot share DNA:

1. **AGENTS.md pattern** - Project context files
2. **Skill system** - Extensible capabilities
3. **Terminal-first** - CLI-based workflow
4. **Multi-provider** - Flexible model selection
