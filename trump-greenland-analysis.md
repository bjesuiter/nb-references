## Overview

Discussion and analysis of potential geopolitical scenarios if Trump pursues control or influence over Greenland.

## Key Context

Greenland is:
- An autonomous territory of Denmark
- Strategically located in the Arctic
- Home to US military base (Pituffik/Thule)
- Rich in rare earth minerals
- Increasingly important due to Arctic melting

## Potential Scenarios Discussed

### 1. Diplomatic Pressure
- Negotiations with Denmark for increased US presence
- Economic incentives and investment deals
- Joint development agreements

### 2. Military Expansion
- Increased US military footprint
- New bases or expanded existing ones
- Arctic surveillance and defense systems

### 3. Economic Acquisition
- Purchase offer (like 1946)
- Investment in infrastructure
- Mining rights for rare earths

### 4. Annexation (Hypothetical)
- Considered highly unlikely by most analysts
- Would require Danish consent or forceful action
- Would violate international law

## Implications

### For Denmark
- Loss of territory
- Economic impact
- NATO alliance strain

### For Greenland
- Economic development
- Self-determination questions
- Improved infrastructure

### For Arctic
- Geopolitical shift
- Resource competition
- Climate change response

### For NATO
- Alliance dynamics
- Russia/China response
- Arctic security
