## My Reference

### Summary
Nitropage is an open-source visual website builder based on SolidStart (SolidJS framework). It's a design-focused toolbox with drag-and-drop functionality, completely free and open source.

### Key Features
- **Visual WYSIWYG Editor** - Inline richtext editing, drag and drop, responsive viewport handles, zoom, color scheme simulation
- **36 Versatile Blueprints** - Building blocks library for creating pages
- **Reusable Layouts** - Create layouts with multiple elements, slots, and nested layouts
- **Project-wide Defaults** - Define defaults and override per element
- **Self-hosted & Privacy-friendly** - Use own fonts or privacy-friendly CDN

### Vision & Goals
- Focus on designable elements, not structured data
- Balance content creators, designers, and developers
- Simplify deployment of small websites

### Use Cases
- Landing pages ✅ Ideal
- Individual content-heavy sites ✅
- Product showcases ✅
- Portfolios ✅
- Small blogs ⚠️ Manual management required
- Ecommerce ❌ Not supported (future possibility)

### Installation
```bash
pnpm create nitropage@latest
```

### Technical Stack
- **Framework:** SolidStart (SolidJS)
- **License:** Open Source
- **Repository:** codeberg.org/nitropage/nitropage

### Boundaries
- No old browser compatibility priority
- Updates via developer installation (not auto)
- No Nitropage-specific hosting (deployment is simple)

### Why Interesting
- Alternative to Wix/Squarespace/Webflow but open source
- Design-focused vs CMS-focused
- SolidJS for performance
- Complete control over hosting/deployment
