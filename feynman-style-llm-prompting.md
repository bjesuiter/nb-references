## My Reference

### The Technique

Ask the LLM to explain topics in the style of Richard Feynman — the physicist's favorite physicist, known for making complex ideas accessible through simple language and real-world analogies.

### Why It Works

- **No jargon overload** — Breaks down complex concepts
- **Relatable analogies** — Uses everyday examples to explain abstract ideas
- **Step-by-step simplicity** — Builds understanding incrementally
- **Avoids overcomplication** — Gets to the core without unnecessary complexity

### Example Prompt Template

> "Explain [complex topic] to me like I'm a complete beginner. Use the Feynman technique — simple language, real-world analogies, and avoid jargon. Pretend you're teaching someone with no prior knowledge."

### Feynman Principles Applied

1. **Simplicity over technical precision** — Understandability first
2. **Analogies** — Connect abstract to concrete
3. **No assumed knowledge** — Start from true zero
4. **Curiosity-driven** — Explain why things work, not just how

### Common Variations

- "Explain like I'm 5 (ELI5)"
- "Teach me like a good teacher would"
- "Use an analogy from everyday life"
- "What would you tell a complete beginner?"

### Best Use Cases

- Understanding technical concepts quickly
- Learning new domains without prior background
- Breaking down algorithms, physics, economics, etc.
- Making documentation more accessible

### The Feynman Legacy

Richard Feynman was famous for his ability to explain the most complex physics to anyone. His key insight: if you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough.
